        <p>
            I'm Nat Taylor. I'm fourteen years old and I love programming. I know a few languages and are learning more. I specialize in python (Like all 14 year 
            old 'Programmers') and have worked with numerous APIs. I also know HTML5 and CSS3, as well as a moderate amount of javascript and am learning Java for use 
            in my robotics team, the Circuit Runners. I am very interested in machine learning and hope to get a PHD in it. Along with programming, I also play high school
            baseball at Wheeler. My dream job is to be a machine learning researcher at Google. My goal for my time here at Wheeler is to get out of being a poser and be able to call myself a real programmer.

        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>My first experience coding was a scratch class in 5th grade. Since then, I've gone on to several classes and programs.
            I had a Python class in 8th grade, and that's when I decided I wanted to program. I've taken several online classes on
            <a href = 'https://www.codeacademy.com' target = '_blank' style = 'color: rgb(177, 110, 117)' >CodeAcademy.com</a> and have  learned HTML, and CSS. At the 
            moment I am learning Java on CodeAcademy as well as reading a book on it. I am also in the Wheeler High School coding club, where I will
            learn Angular.js, Node.js, and React.js. In that program I will also learn SQL. I do robotics and program for my team in Java. 
            You can check out my Github for more info on my biggest projects.
